# NFL-Betting-Models
## Project Overview
This project aims to create a comprehensive suite of NFL betting models that leverage machine learning and statistical techniques. The main objectives are:

1. Effective Data Pipeline: To fetch, clean, and aggregate play-by-play NFL data.
2. Statistical and Machine Learning Models: To predict game outcomes for both spread and total betting.
3. User Interface: To display predictions and insights through an intuitive UI.

## Current Status
### Completed
Data Loading: Successfully loaded play-by-play data.

### In Progress
Week-by-Week Data: Currently perfecting the creation of week-by-week statistics.

Rolling Averages: Creating rolling averages from the week-by-week data.
### Planned
Betting Models: Development of various betting models including:
1. Linear Regression with Various Quantile Loss Functions
2. Neural Networks with Various Quantile Loss Functions
3. Potentially other model types, like tree-based models. 
UI Development: User interface for model interaction.

## Technology Stack
Python
Pandas for data manipulation
nfl_data_py for fetching NFL data
Planned: PyTorch for machine learning models

## How to Run
Instructions to set up and run the project will be coming soon.
